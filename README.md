## Lessons Learned
Learning how to use SQL and the JDBC were the newest skill set's achieved in order to properly execute the FilmQueryProject. The trickiest lesson is understanding how to use predicates and functions in a manner that makes them compatible in Java. Another detrimental mistake taught me a great lesson this week. The lack of proper whitespace within my code caused the program to be unable to pull data points.
